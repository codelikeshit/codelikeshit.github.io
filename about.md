* I am Peeyush Singla, Rails developer @ [Ad2games](https://ad2games.com).
* In love with Ruby and I seriously feel its awesome, its the best programming language I came across till now ;).
* I believe in automation of stuff and always try to imporve/optimize continiously. I believe if we are doing some stuff again then we should outsource that to scripts, that do all that for us :).
* You can contact me on my [Linkedin](https://in.linkedin.com/pub/peeyush-singla/48/1b2/667) if you have something challenging to work on.
